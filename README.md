# Coffi –– User-Created Coffee Menu

I decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard.


1) Displays graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allows public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allows the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allows the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
